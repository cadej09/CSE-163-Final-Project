2. How does employer’s mental health support potentially impact an employee’s decision on whether to share their mental health status?
3. What are patterns or trends in the relationship between age and the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment? 
4. How does the size of a tech company, as indicated by the number of employees, impact the likelihood of the company providing resources for employees to learn more about mental health issues and seek help?
5. How does the state in which participants live impact the likelihood of seeking mental health treatment?

## Instructions

1. Download the zip file and make sure all the folders and files are under the same directory since our code contains saving images to and pulling dataset from a local path.
2. Run the files in the folder "py_modules" to get our result. Each file represents a research question, and all the visualization output will be saved to the "output" folder.
3. To access our original data, go to the folder named "data."
4. To successfully run the py files, download the following libraries: os, pandas, numpy, sklearn, graphviz, IPython, plotly, and kaleido. You can use the following method to install them: type "pip install <library_name>" in the terminal.
5. For the graphviz library, "pip install" will not work. Instead, try "conda install -c conda-forge python-graphviz" in the terminal.
6. For the interactive graph, it is saved as an HTML file to enable its interactive functionality. Double-clicking on the HTML file opens up the graph in a browser.

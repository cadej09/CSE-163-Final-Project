# CSE-163-Final-Project
First, download the zip file and make sure all the folders and files are under
the same directory since our code contains saving images to and pulling dataset from
a local path. Run the files in the folder "py_modules" to get our result. Each
file represents a research question, and all the visualization output will be saved
to the "output" folder. To access our original data, go to the folder named "data."

* To successfully run the py files, download the following libraries:
  os, pandas, numpy, sklearn, graphviz, IPython, plotly, and kaleido. you can use the
  following method to install them: type "pip install <library_name>" in the terminal
  <For the graphviz library, "pip install" will not work. Instead, try "conda install -c conda-forge
  python-graphviz" in the terminal>
* For the interactive graph, it is saved as a html file to enable its interactive
  funcyionality. Double clicking on the html file opens us the graph in a browser.

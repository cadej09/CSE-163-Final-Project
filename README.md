# CSE-163-Final-Project
First, we recommand to clone our repository on Github, which is the easiest and
safest way to run our code. If not, make sure all the folders and files are under
the same directory since our code contains saving images to and pulling dataset from
a local path. Run the files in the folder "py_modules" to get our result. Each
file represents a research question, and all the visualization output will be saved
to the "output" folder.
* To successfully run the py files, download the following libraries:
  os, pandas, numpy, sklearn, IPython, plotly, and kaleido.
